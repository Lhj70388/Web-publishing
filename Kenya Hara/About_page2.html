            <p1>Kenya Hara’s artistic process begins with a strong conceptual foundation. He often
                <br> explores deep philosophical ideas and concepts, drawing inspiration from nature,
                <br>Japanese culture, and therelationship between objects and people. He seeks to
                <br>create works that provoke thought and evoke emotions.
            </p1>
            <br>
            <br>

            <p2>Hara experiments with a wide range of materials to bring his ideas to life. He explores
                <br>traditional Japanese materials and craftsmanship techniques, as well as modern
                <br>materials and technologies. Through material exploration, he aims to find the most
                <br>suitable medium to express his concept effectively

        <p>In 1992 he founded Hara Design Institute working in the whole field of design from advertising
            <br>to branding, exhibit design, sign systems, packaging, products, and books. His design communicates
            <br>the essence through the essential: The profound meaning of each reality through symbolic visual
            <br>solutions that have their origin in Japanese traditional culture.

            <br><br>Over the years, he has worked for major Japanese clients including Art Setouchi Triennale, Kenzo,
            <br>Matsuya department stores, the Nagasaki Prefectural Art Museum, Tsutaya Books, and the
            <br>Umeda Hospital. In 1998 he also designed the opening and closing ceremonies of Nagano

            <p><br><br>In 2001 he was appointed Muji’s art director by Ikko Tanaka, a master of Japanese graphic
                <br>design who was its former art director. Since then, he both develops communication design and
                <br>helps the company to formulate an integrated vision. He curates Muji’s advertising, apps,
                <br> commercials, exhibitions, magazine, and packaging following the original concept that “sometimes
                <br>simplicity surpasses splendor.” Under his art direction, Muji has become an international symbol
                <br>of aesthetic and conceptual quality.
