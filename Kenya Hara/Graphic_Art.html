                <p>These posters were produced for the annual paper show held by Takeo,   
                    <br> a paper trading company. The posters on display date from 1990   
                    <br> through 1994, showing Hara's experiments with form and texture 
                    <br>that date back to the earliest days of his career. In the printing 
                    <br>process, he combined textures of things like gold foil, fruit skin
                    <br> and such with abstract forms with three-dimensional shadows.

            <div id="content02">
                <p>Graphic designer Takenobu Igarashi and Hara worked on a series of 
                    <br> five graphics on the theme of Life. Hara made sketch after sketch,  
                    <br> based on the images they get when they sense the tension and 
                    <br>vines and stems. The images are tangible, but the shapes are not a 
                    <br> island of Shikoku. Reproduction of anything in particular, they 
                    <br>are but an abstract.

                    <br>University revisited a posters project from 36 years earlier.
                    <br>Kenya Hara was responsible for "Noh," and his poster illustrates
                    <br> the emergence of an image on a Noh mask. Below the poster are 
                    <br>three rough sketches.
